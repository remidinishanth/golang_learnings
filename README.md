### Go's 21st Century Characteristics
* Concurrency
* Distributed Systems
* Garbage Collection
* Memory Locality
* Readability

#### Concurrency
* **Concurrent**:
Go makes it easy to “fire off” functions to be run as very lightweight threads. These threads are called goroutines in Go.
* **Channels**: Communication with these goroutines is done, either via shared state or via channels.
