## Reflection
* Go provides a mechanism to update variables, inspect their values at runtime, call their methods,
and apply the operations intrinsic to their representation without knowing their types at compile time. 
* This mechanism is called reflection.
* Reflection also lets us treat types themselves as first-class values.


Reflection in computing is the ability of a program to examine its own structure, particularly through types; itâ€™s a form of metaprogramming.
